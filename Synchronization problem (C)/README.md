My project solves a modified synchronization problem called "The roller coaster problem".   
Suppose there are P passengers and one roller coaster car. The passengers repeatedly wait to ride in the car, which can hold maximum C passengers, where C < P and P % C == 0. However, the car can go around the track only when it is full while other passengers have to wait.
